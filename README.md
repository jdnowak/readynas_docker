This READYNAS docker only binary files repository. Present At least 19.03 docker is needed for Home Assistant, but nowhere was available so own binary 19.03.

This is not install, only binary, so install older version, look where is present(//which), rename it and copy this one or make symbolic link for it. Up to you.
